# Parking-Lot
Code and all related materials for techgig Artificial Challenge round 2. The goal is to detect free parking lot spaces from cameras images and share it with the drivers to help reduce the time it takes to find parking space, thus reducing fuel consumption and time.

__Note__ :- Work in progress. In case you see some discrepencies in the paths, that is because I initially did most of the stuff in `/Desktop/Kaggle/techgig` folder and after testing moved everything to `/Desktop/Github/Parking-Lot` folder.
